# Statistical-Arbitrage-Mean-Reversion-Dashboard
Created a statistical arbitrage mean-reversion dashboard in Python, which takes a list of stocks of your choosing with a time frame as well and calculates z-entry, z-exit, spread, Sharpe ratio, and rolling means to assist investors in stat arb strategies and help them visualize them. The dashboard shows spreads and helps investors see which pairs are correlated, showing them where to short and long certain stock pairs.
